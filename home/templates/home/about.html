        <h2 style="color: #006994; margin-bottom: 30px;">Why We Started CoralOffice</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">After years of working in the diving industry, we noticed that many dive centers were still using outdated methods to manage their operations. Paper logbooks, scattered spreadsheets, and manual processes were not only inefficient but also posed safety risks.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;">CoralOffice was born from the need for a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that could handle everything from course management to equipment tracking, while maintaining the highest safety standards that our marine environment deserves.</p>
